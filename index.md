# Akash Bapat | Computer Vision
Hi, my name is Akash Bapat.
I am a Ph.D student in the computer science department of UNC Chapel Hill advised by <a href="http://frahm.web.unc.edu/">Jan-Michael Frahm</a>.
My interests are computer vision and augmented and virtual reality.
My research interests can be traced to my <a href="http://www.iitgn.ac.in/">IITGN</a> days where I worked with Prof. <a href="http://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/electrical/shanmuganathan.htm">Raman</a>.
